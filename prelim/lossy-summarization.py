"""
 Sketch algorithms were developed to approximate answers to questions such as:
 1. Set membership
 2. Cardinality estimation
 3. Frequency.

 1. Update in the order of O(1)
 2. Storage space is independent of the size of the stream
 3. Read in linear time.

 Downside:
 1. Tolerable Errors in results.

 Algorithms:
 1. Bloom Filters.
 2. Min Count
 3. HyperLogLog
 4. Count-Min Sketch
